## Background

It was my first time to participate in HKCERT CTF, and I felt that the challenges was more difficult to solve compared to PWC Hackaday.

Frankly speaking, this was really a challenge for me as a newcomer to CTF. But luckily I managed to solve some of the challenges through persisitent googleing after staying up all night for 2 days. (I could say I have a strong liver now.)

## Problem Solved
